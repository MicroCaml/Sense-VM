# Arguments for and against different features of Sense-VM



## Bytecode

### Points in favour

- Having total control of the instruction set means that we can limit
  the power of a malicious piece of software.
- Easier to implement than a native code compiler.
- Portability

### Points against (and counterarguments)

- Embedded system and IoT applications are very diverse and run on
  very diverse hardware. What is the point of bytecode if it really
  wont be that portable anyway?
  - This comes down to how good we are to creating a uniform abstraction
    layer over the diverse hardware. hardware may be diverse but will probaly
    fall into categories that operate in similar ways.

### Garbage Collected Heap
