### RELATED WORK 2

- [The Space Cost of Lazy Reference Counting](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/982962.964019)
  - Section 3 summarizes lazy deletion of garbage. While the problems associated with lazy deletion might not immediately occur
    in our heap, but when we introduce arrays and other forms of contiguous allocations we will encounter the issues listed in the paper.
    The paper also includes a good benchmark on the pause times of reference counting (while freeing). Note it remains to be seen how these
    benchmarks translate to a functional language.

- [An efficient, incremental, automatic garbage collector](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/360336.360345)
  - Uses two tables MRT(Mutireference table) and ZCT(Zero count table) two segregate references based on their count. There is an additonal
    variable reference table (VRT) "which contains in a hash table all those pointers referenced from the stack. Then the ZCT can be scanned, 
    and any cell not referenced from the VRT can be reclaimed.". It doesn't account for cycles and uses GC to collect them.
