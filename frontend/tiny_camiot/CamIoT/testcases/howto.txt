I imagine we will create pairs of files such as `test1.cam` & `test1.out`, where the file suffixed with
`out` will contain the stdout of the program in `test1.cam`. The test program will then just
read in all the pairs, compile & run the `.cam` and compare the output against that in `.out`.

Simple enough!
