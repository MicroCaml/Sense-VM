* (manual work, not difficult) Write more detailed error messages! The machinery is there already, it is just a matter of writing them.
* (manual work, might be tricky, I guess) make most of the TC functions polymorphic in the monad
  that does the typechecking. Create constraints instead! Say that it must be a monadState etc. This
  way we can reuse some of the utility functions!
* typechecking patterns, in ADT's, make sure that it throws the custom error message instead of
  throwing the one in the unifyer first. The test for the error is written now, but it isn't invoked.
  The unifier can use `catchError` _if_ there is a custom error message given, otherwise it can throw
  the one it seems fit (like the very non-descriptive unification errors etc).
* case checking on line 374, the error is rendered incorrectly..
* We should try to be more correct about the way types are handled right now. Checking that ADTs and type constructors
  are correctly applied etc is very crude. We should perhaps try to do it in terms of kinds and stuff, like it is done in Haskell.
* Basically I believe the typechecker could benefit from a rewrite now that I know how it should work. Right now it's an initial attempt that has been quickfixed a few times too many.

* some notion of function (entity that holds a list of definitions) should be added, instead of passing
  around a list of `[Def a]` in the compiler.

* move `renameExp` from `LambdaLifting` and generalise. It can probably be reused in a lot of places.

* The monomorphizer needs a runover. Some of the code does a little too much and it can be structured nicer.

* add a `main` to the pipeline. The typechecker should check for its presence and for its type.
