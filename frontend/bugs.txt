This program is buggy

data List a where
  Nil  : List a
  Cons : a -> List a -> List a

reverse2 xs = case xs of
    Nil -> (Nil, Nil)
    (Cons x (Cons y ys)) -> (Cons y (Cons x Nil), xs)

main = reverse2 (Cons 1 (Cons 2 Nil))


Inferred result type of reverse2 is `(List p, List d)`, while they should obviously
be of the same type.
