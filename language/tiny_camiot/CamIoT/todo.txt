* Type checking recursive functions does not work unless there is an explicit type signature for the function.
  Do we force type signatures on functions? I like the idea, but it will lead to very simple things being
  unecessarily cluttered. Perhaps we can do a check on a functions body to see if it is recursive, and if it is,
  force the user to annotate just _that_ function.
